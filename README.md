This app fetches Leetcode statistics and and shows .  
I am working on making widgets for this data , which will be placed on homescreen.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
       <a href="https://github.com/0-0Rohit-Roshan"><img alt="Dark Theme" src="Resource/Dark.jpg" /></a>
    </td>
    <td>
      <a href="https://github.com/0-0Rohit-Roshan"><img alt="Light Theme" src="Resource/Light.jpg"/></a>
    </td>
  </tr>
 </table>

 **Setup**  
 Download the code and let Android studio do it's work.
